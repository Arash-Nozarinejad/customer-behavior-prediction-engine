# E-commerce Customer Behavior Prediction and Recommendation Engine

## Project Overview

This project implements a comprehensive e-commerce recommendation and prediction system designed to demonstrate data science expertise across multiple domains:

- **Customer Segmentation**: Identifying distinct customer groups through RFM analysis and clustering
- **Recommendation Systems**: Building collaborative filtering, content-based, and hybrid recommendation models
- **Predictive Analytics**: Developing models for churn prediction and customer lifetime value forecasting
- **Business Intelligence**: Translating technical results into actionable business insights

### Business Context

This project simulates work as a senior data scientist at GlobalShop, a major e-commerce platform with 35 million active users facing concerning trends:

- 14% increase in customer churn year-over-year
- 8% decline in average order value among long-term customers  
- Recommendation click-through rates underperforming industry benchmarks by 22%

### Project Objectives

1. Deliver personalized product recommendations that outperform the current system
2. Identify customers at risk of churning before they disengage
3. Predict customer lifetime value to enable targeted retention strategies  
4. Uncover cross-selling opportunities based on purchase patterns

## Data Sources

This project utilizes publicly available e-commerce datasets from Kaggle:

1. [E-commerce User Behavior Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mkechinov/ecommerce-behavior-data-from-multi-category-store)
2. [Online Retail II Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mashlyn/online-retail-ii-uci)
3. [Customer Personality Analysis Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis)

## Implementation Approach

This project follows a structured workflow through 8 key notebooks:

1. **Data Acquisition and Exploration**: Understanding e-commerce data and customer behavior patterns
2. **Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering**: Creating meaningful features from raw data
3. **Customer Segmentation**: Identifying distinct customer groups for targeted strategies
4. **Recommendation System - Collaborative Filtering**: Building user-item interaction based recommendation systems
5. **Recommendation System - Content-Based and Hybrid**: Leveraging product attributes for recommendations
6. **Churn Prediction**: Predicting customer disengagement for proactive retention
7. **Customer Lifetime Value Prediction**: Forecasting long-term customer value
8. **Business Impact and Implementation**: Translating technical results into business value
